		<h2>Graduation</h2>

			<hr />
<p>I recently graduated college. <em>applause</em> . But it&#8217;s a funny thing not being a student anymore and I don&#8217;t mean bad funny. It feels good. Almost like I&#8217;m ready to contribute something to the world. Almost. If you think about it, I&#8217;m 22 years old and I haven&#8217;t contributed nothing to society, all I&#8217;ve ever been is a consumer. A consumer of education (that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing), a consumer of other people&#8217;s money, and a consumer of other people&#8217;s creations. I try not to consume too much though by <em>avoiding TV</em>and keeping hobbies.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m ready to start a job and get a real income. I&#8217;ve had enough textbook.</p>

<p>Over the four years I did make a few observations:</p>

<ol>
<li>For a bunch of <em>educated</em> people, college students are stupid. Educated idiots.</li>

<li>The number of liberal professors is astounding. There is no way a student can become totally educated hearing only one side. A lot of students are liberal or democrat not because they think it&#8217;s better, but because it&#8217;s the only thing they know. What a shame.</li>

<li>The number of women that walked across the stage at graduation compared to men wasn&#8217;t proportional. Women outnumbered men at least 2:1. I don&#8217;t want to hear about women being discriminated against ever again.</li>
</ol>
