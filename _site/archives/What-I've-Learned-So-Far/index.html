                    <div class="posts">
                        <p>After my first week of having a <em>real</em> job, this is what I&#8217;ve learned.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>I am not the great programmer I thought I was.</strong> This isn&#8217;t at all a bad thing though. As it turns, I have a lot to learn. Getting an education is a nice touch and something to put on resumes, but it does little in the way of actually preparing you for work life. I have personally learned that there is a large chasm between developing small programs working with one algorithm at a time and being able to develop something that is marketable and an actual product. Even my own side projects that I&#8217;ve taken on over the years are small and simple in comparison to developing an actual product. <em>I think it&#8217;s also important to note here that in a real production environmdent you&#8217;re working with more than one language at a time.</em> So it might be nice to know the depth of Java, it&#8217;s also important to be able to pick up other languages quickly and be able to see how they integrate with what your working with.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Microsoft is a lot cooler than I&#8217;ve been told to believe.</strong> Yes, Windows 8 still sucks. Yes, Microsoft as a company doesn&#8217;t seem to have a real clear direction. But behind all of those things that Microsoft does wrong that you hear about most frequently, they do a lot of things right. Microsoft Visual Studio is cool, plain and simple. Sure it&#8217;s just an IDE but it&#8217;s literally one of the best for developing Microsoft programs, and a lot of companies, believe it or not, are developing Microsoft programs. ( <em>On a side note, the other IDE that I really like is NetBeans which is great for developing almost anything with and Sublime Text, which sure is technically just a text editor, but it&#8217;s so damn slick looking</em> ). C# is also a really nice language and easy to pick up if you already know a little Java or some other Class Object language.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>The company you work for is important.</strong> It&#8217;s a rare environment where people can have fun <em>and</em> get work done at the same time, which I think is one of the biggest differences between working with a small company or a large corporation. Small companies are lean, which as a software developer is important, and can get away from all the corporate bullshit. Now I don&#8217;t know what being a software developer for a large corporation is like, but I know one thing and it&#8217;s that I am for sure not working for the man.</p>
</li>
</ol>
