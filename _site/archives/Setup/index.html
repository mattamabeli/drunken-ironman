                    <div class="posts">
                        <p>I spend a lot of time at my computer and people like me also spend a lot of time at their computers. So I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my <del>setup</del> Battle Station and how I work.</p>

<p>The most important part of your setup is not your computer, it&#8217;s your monitor(s). Think about it, your computer is useless without some screen. And so a good screen is more than worth it. I use a 27&#8221; AOC monitor hooked up to my laptop that provides me with maximum screen real estate. It&#8217;s big, it&#8217;s clear, it&#8217;s colorful, and I wish I had two (three?) of them.</p>

<p>Trailing in second is my Lenovo ideapad u530. It&#8217;s running a dual-core i7, that is surprisingly powerful. I&#8217;ve had this thing for more than a few months now, and like spending time with all things, you start to notice it&#8217;s flaws. One. It only has one hdmi port (this isn&#8217;t really a flaw of this laptop, just the nature of laptops in general). Two. The screen&#8217;s not IPS, it&#8217;s a good screen but not a great screen.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been skeptical of the usefullness of expensive keyboards. But after spending hours typing for months, I&#8217;m convinced a good keyboard is a must. Over in this corner of the woods we&#8217;re rocking the Microsoft Sculpt keyboard that makes typing a lot less straining.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the Microsoft Arc Touch mouse. Besides a few quirks where scrolling is funning, this is the best mouse I&#8217;ve ever used. It&#8217;s light weight on my crammed desk and it&#8217;s portability means it&#8217;s staying with for awhile.</p>

<p>I use a Dell Venue Pro 8 as my tablet and a regular laptop bag to carry things around in as well as Bose QC15 acoustic noise cancelling headphones as my ear pleasurers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m tired of writing. Out.</p>
