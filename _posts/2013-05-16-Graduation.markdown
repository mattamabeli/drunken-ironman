----------

I recently graduated college. But it's a funny thing not being a student anymore and I don't mean bad funny. It feels good. Almost like I'm ready to contribute something to the world. Almost. If you think about it, I'm 22 years old and I haven't contributed nothing to society, all I've ever been is a consumer. A consumer of education (that's not necessarily a bad thing), a consumer of other people's money, and a consumer of other people's creations. I try not to consume too much though by 
*avoiding TV 
*and keeping hobbies.

I'm ready to start a job and get a real income. I've had enough textbook.

Over the four years I did make a few observations:
1. For a bunch of _educated_ people, college students are stupid.
2. The number of liberal professors is astounding. There is no way a student can become totally educated hearing only one side. A lot of students are liberal or democrat not because they think it's better, but because it's the only thing they know. It's the only thing you hear in college.
3. The number of women that walked across the stage at graduation compared to men wasn't proportional. Women outnumbered men at least 2:1. I don't want to hear about women being discriminated against ever again.
