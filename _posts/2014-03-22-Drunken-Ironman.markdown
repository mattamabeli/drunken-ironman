When I first created this blog over a year ago, I wanted something quick, dirty, and free (QDAF). So Jekyll hosted on GitHub with the shell of bootstrap it was. And since that first year this blog went on to become one of the top 150 sites in the country. Well...not exactly. What actually happened is I posted a few times and never touched this thing again. I'll admit, not a great start. But then something happened. Something that I promised myself would never happen again. I forked this blogs repository from Github after seeing a post about how to make sprites in css that I wanted to try out. After I created my sprite I kept messing around until I hooked myself into revamping mattsheehan.

The revamping started with creating a css grid framework, which the beginnings of are used on this site and will soon be an independent repository on Github. I wanted something like bootstrap or any of the other hundreds of grid frameworks but without all the weight. Something light, portable, can be built from as a starting point for other sites. The framework's no where near where I want it to be, but it's a better start than before.

I'm starting to learn the in's and out's of Jekyll as well. But I don't love it. It's where this blog lives for now but as I start implementing the future of my projects this site will probably move to Ghost. The benefits of Ghost you ask compared to Jekyll? Well heres a few.

1. Ghost uses Node.js. Jekyll's backend is Ruby. I prefer to mess with Node.js.

2. Ghost at least uses sqlite. Jekyll uses no database, just flat files. Which is no harder to manage until after you reach the point where you have more than five posts (which we are approaching!). Sqlite is not hard. It's a nice little database perfect for blogs. Jekyll just has more baggage.

3. I like that Jekyll uses liquid html templating. Ghost also uses something similiar. Ok fine we'll call this one a draw.


So there that's it. Mattsheehan is going to stay my bloggin platform, one way or another. If you ever check out Bitwhisp, that's cool as well, but I don't have the blogging stamina to manage two similar sites.
